Project Motivation: 

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, as well as the most common form of dementia, that is often characterized by memory and cognitive impairment, which negatively affects behavior, speech, and the motor system. In the United states alone, there are approximately 5.8 million senior citizens with Alzheimer’s disease, a number predicted to double in the next 30 years. Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) is a noticeable condition that affects an individual’s thinking ability, and those with MCI are more susceptible to developing Alzheimer’s Disease. However, the cause of Alzheimer’s Disease is not fully understood and there is no medication to stop its progression. 99.6% of clinical trials—to treat AD—result in failure as AD cannot be easily detected in its early stages, and when AD and dementia are discovered it's often too late. 

A model that can accurately and inexpensively predict someone's future condition will help immensly for aiding in healthcare and clinical trials. Healthcare costs are often too high for most people to recieve MRI tests, and often in rural communities, one has to travel for days or even weeks to go to their closest hospital. Thus, my project's aim is to predict the future MMSE (indicator of dementia) score of patients and the future state (Cognitive Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or Alzhiemer's Disease) using markers that can easily be aqcuired.
